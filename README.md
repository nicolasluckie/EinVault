## Production (Docker)

Requires Docker Engine 24+, Docker Compose v2, and a reverse proxy for TLS (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik, or similar).

Download [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](docker-compose.prod.yml) and set your domain before starting:

**`ORIGIN`** — your public domain:

```yaml
ORIGIN: https://einvault.yourdomain.com
```

Then:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Open your domain and follow the `/setup` prompt to create your admin account.

### Other options

Everything else in the compose file can be edited directly:

|                         | Default             | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TZ`                    | `UTC`               | Container timezone. Set to your local timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`) so dates and times display correctly.                            |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB`         | `10`                | Maximum size in MB for image (photo and avatar) uploads. `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` is derived from the larger of this and `VIDEO_MAX_MB` at container start.       |
| `VIDEO_MAX_MB`          | `100`               | Maximum size in MB for journal video uploads. Videos are stored as-is unless transcoding is enabled (see below).                                           |
| `MAX_DAILY_MEDIA`       | `5`                 | Maximum number of journal photos and videos (combined) per companion per day. (Renamed from `MAX_DAILY_PHOTOS`, still honored with a deprecation warning.) |
| `REMINDER_UNDO_SECONDS` | `7`                 | Default undo window (seconds) when dismissing a Reminder. `0` disables the undo window. Each user can override in their settings.                          |
| `user`                  | `1000:1000`         | UID:GID the container runs as. Change if your `./data` directory has different ownership.                                                                  |
| `./data` volume         | `./data`            | Where the database and uploads are stored on the host.                                                                                                     |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | `/data/einvault.db` | Database path inside the container. Unlikely to need changing.                                                                                             |

### Video transcoding (optional)

By default, uploaded videos are stored exactly as received. A browser can only play codecs it supports, so a clip in a format like H.265/HEVC (common from Apple devices) may fail to play and fall back to a download link.

Set `VIDEO_TRANSCODE=true` to convert each uploaded video to a universal web profile (H.264 + AAC in an MP4 with the moov atom at the front) and generate a poster thumbnail. Conversion runs in the background after upload: the video shows a "converting" state and switches to the playable version when it finishes. The feature is off by default because it is CPU-intensive and depends on `ffmpeg`.

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` ship in the official Docker image, including the HEVC decoder needed to read Apple-recorded source and `libx264` for H.264 output. If you run outside the image and the binaries are not found, the feature disables itself and videos are stored as-is.

|                               | Default                | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VIDEO_TRANSCODE`             | `false`                | Enable background transcoding of uploaded videos to a web-playable MP4 plus a poster.                                                                     |
| `VIDEO_KEEP_ORIGINAL`         | `true`                 | Keep the original source file alongside the transcoded copy. The original is never served; it is retained for re-encoding or backup. `false` discards it. |
| `VIDEO_TRANSCODE_MAX_MB`      | `VIDEO_MAX_MB`         | Skip transcoding (store as-is) for inputs larger than this.                                                                                               |
| `VIDEO_TRANSCODE_MAX_SECONDS` | `600`                  | Skip transcoding for inputs longer than this.                                                                                                             |
| `VIDEO_TRANSCODE_MAX_WIDTH`   | `4096`                 | Skip transcoding for inputs wider than this.                                                                                                              |
| `VIDEO_TRANSCODE_MAX_HEIGHT`  | `4096`                 | Skip transcoding for inputs taller than this.                                                                                                             |
| `VIDEO_FFMPEG_PATH`           | `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`      | Absolute path to the `ffmpeg` binary. Override if it lives elsewhere (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` on macOS).                                          |
| `VIDEO_FFPROBE_PATH`          | `/usr/bin/ffprobe`     | Absolute path to the `ffprobe` binary.                                                                                                                    |
| `VIDEO_TMP_DIR`               | `<data>/transcode-tmp` | Scratch directory for in-progress transcodes. Must be on disk with room for the source plus output. Do not point it at the in-memory `/tmp` tmpfs.        |

Transcoding decodes attacker-supplied media with `ffmpeg`. The shipped compose files already run the container with a read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, and `no-new-privileges`, which contains a decoder exploit. For extra isolation you can run the container without network access.

Transcoding is the only CPU-heavy thing EinVault does. It runs one job at a time with `ffmpeg` capped at two threads, so it never grabs the whole host, but the default `cpus: 0.5` / `memory: 256M` limits in `docker-compose.prod.yml` are sized for the app alone and are too low once it is enabled. With transcoding on, raise them to roughly `cpus: 1.5` (use `1.0` on a small host, `2.0` for the fastest conversions) and `memory: 512M` (`1G` if you allow large or 4K clips). The memory bump matters most: the worker buffers the whole clip while converting, and too low a limit will OOM-kill the job rather than slow it down.

### External image storage (optional)

By default, avatars and journal photos are written to `./data/uploads`. You can instead route new uploads to an S3-compatible bucket (AWS S3, Garage, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2). Existing photos remain on disk; only new writes go to S3.

|                          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND`        | `local` | `local` writes to `./data/uploads`. `s3` writes new uploads to the configured bucket. Reads always honor the per-row provider, so switching does not invalidate old rows. |
| `S3_ENDPOINT`            | —       | Full endpoint URL, e.g. `https://s3.garage.example.com` or `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.                                                                          |
| `S3_BUCKET`              | —       | Bucket name. Must already exist and should be private.                                                                                                                    |
| `S3_REGION`              | `auto`  | Region. For non-AWS providers, `auto` usually works.                                                                                                                      |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`       | —       | Access key. Scope it to this bucket only.                                                                                                                                 |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`   | —       | Secret key.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`    | `false` | Set to `true` for Garage, MinIO, and older S3 deployments. Leave `false` for AWS and R2.                                                                                  |
| `S3_PRESIGN_TTL_SECONDS` | `300`   | Lifetime of presigned download URLs. Shorter is stricter, longer improves browser cache reuse on reload.                                                                  |

Downloads use short-lived presigned URLs (the app issues a 302 redirect). Access control is checked before the URL is issued; once issued, the URL stays valid for the full TTL even if permissions later change. Keep the TTL short.

### Immich integration (optional)

When `IMMICH_URL` and `IMMICH_API_KEY` are set, members and admins get a "Pick from Immich" option on the journal photo and companion avatar flows. The chosen asset stays in Immich; EinVault stores only a reference and proxies reads through the server using the API key. EinVault never uploads to Immich and never deletes assets from it. Caretakers cannot use the picker.

|                   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IMMICH_URL`      | —       | Base URL of your Immich server, e.g. `http://immich.local:2283`. No trailing slash. Required if `IMMICH_API_KEY` is set.                                                                     |
| `IMMICH_API_KEY`  | —       | API key. Required permissions: `asset.read`, `asset.view`, plus `album.read` if `IMMICH_ALBUM_ID` is set. Generate in Immich → Account Settings → API Keys. Required if `IMMICH_URL` is set. |
| `IMMICH_ALBUM_ID` | —       | If set, the picker only shows assets in this album. If unset, the picker shows the user's most recent assets across the whole library.                                                       |

### SMTP email (optional)

When `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_FROM` are both set, EinVault enables outbound email and adds a self-service "Forgot password?" link on the login page. When SMTP is configured, users can also opt in (Settings -> Notifications) to an email when a reminder comes due, and to an email 24 hours before a caretaker shift starts or ends. Caretakers only receive reminder emails for companions assigned to them, and shift emails for their own shifts. Both variables must be set together; setting only one disables email and logs a warning at startup.

`ORIGIN` must be set correctly: password reset links are built from it. Behind a reverse proxy, make sure `ORIGIN` matches the public URL users see.

|               | Default | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SMTP_HOST`   | —       | SMTP server hostname. Required (with `SMTP_FROM`) to enable email.                                                              |
| `SMTP_PORT`   | `587`   | SMTP port. Use `465` with `SMTP_SECURE=true` for implicit TLS, or `587` (default) for STARTTLS.                                 |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `false` | `true` = implicit TLS (port 465). `false` = STARTTLS upgrade on connect.                                                        |
| `SMTP_USER`   | —       | SMTP username. Leave unset for unauthenticated relays.                                                                          |
| `SMTP_PASS`   | —       | SMTP password. Leave unset for unauthenticated relays.                                                                          |
| `SMTP_FROM`   | —       | RFC 5322 From address shown to recipients, e.g. `EinVault <einvault@example.com>`. Required (with `SMTP_HOST`) to enable email. |

### ntfy push notifications (optional)

When `NTFY_URL` is set, EinVault can publish push notifications via [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh). This configures the server only (base URL and optional access token). Each user sets their own topic name under Settings -> Notifications; a non-empty topic is that user's opt-in for pushes scoped to what they can see in the app (reminders due, shift alerts). The notification scheduler runs when either SMTP or ntfy is configured. The forgot-password flow remains email-only.

On public servers like ntfy.sh, the topic name is the only access control. Users should pick long, random topic names that are hard to guess.

|              | Default | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NTFY_URL`   | —       | ntfy server base URL, e.g. `https://ntfy.sh` or a self-hosted instance. No topic in the URL.             |
| `NTFY_TOKEN` | —       | Bearer token for self-hosted ntfy servers with auth enabled. Used for every publish regardless of topic. |

### Data and backup

Data lives in `./data` next to the compose file. Stop the container first so SQLite isn't mid-write, then copy the directory:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop einvault
cp -r ./data ./data.bak
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start einvault
```

### Container hardening

|                     |                                         |

| `latest`       | Latest stable release (published on version tags)   |
| `x.y.z`        | Pinned release                                      |
| `x.y`          | Latest patch of a minor release                     |
| `main`         | Latest commit on `main`, unstable, for testing only |
| `sha-<commit>` | Specific commit build, useful for rollback          |

### Verifying releases

Each release image carries a Sigstore-signed SLSA provenance attestation and a SPDX SBOM, and only ships after Trivy clears the OS and library packages on both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#verifying-releases) for the verification commands.

- **`:latest`** is the lowest-friction default and what `docker-compose.prod.yml` uses. A `docker compose pull` will follow new releases automatically, so a hypothetical poisoned release would auto-deploy. Acceptable for casual homelab use, especially when paired with manual `gh attestation verify` before the pull.
- **`:vX.Y.Z`** pins to a specific release. Auto-updaters like Watchtower will not move past it. Recommended for production deployments.
- **`@sha256:<digest>`** pins to the exact bytes you verified. Immune to registry retags or future republishing. Recommended for hardened deployments.

---

## Docker (local build)

Builds the image locally instead of pulling from GHCR. Useful for testing Dockerfile changes or working on EinVault itself:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

All the same env vars work here. `ORIGIN` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` so no `.env` is needed for a basic smoke test.

---

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20+, npm 10+, and the native build tools for `better-sqlite3` and `sharp`:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3 g++ make`
- macOS: `brew install python3` (Xcode Command Line Tools provides g++ and make)

```bash
npm install
npm run db:generate   # generate migration files from the schema
npm run db:migrate    # apply migrations
npm run dev           # http://localhost:5173
```

No `.env` needed. The database defaults to `./data/einvault.db` and migrations run on startup. Open `http://localhost:5173` and you'll land on `/setup` to create your admin account.

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # production build
npm run check          # SvelteKit type checking
npm run lint           # ESLint + Prettier check
npm run format         # auto-format with Prettier
npm run db:generate    # generate a migration file after schema changes
npm run db:migrate     # apply pending migrations
npm run db:studio      # Drizzle Studio (visual database browser)
```

When you change `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`, run `db:generate` then `db:migrate` and commit both files together.

## User management

- First run redirects to `/setup` to create the initial admin account (one-time only)
- Manage users at `/admin/users`: create accounts, reset passwords, deactivate users
- No open registration

---

## OIDC / SSO (optional)

EinVault supports OpenID Connect for SSO with providers like Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak, and PocketID. OIDC runs alongside password login; existing users keep their passwords. A "Sign in with {provider}" button appears on the login page when OIDC is configured.

OIDC is **disabled** unless all required variables are set. Add them to your `.env` (local) or compose file (production), then restart.

Register `https://<your-domain>/auth/oidc/callback` as an allowed redirect URI with your IdP first.

### Required variables

| Variable             | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`    | IdP base URL. Discovery happens at `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. e.g. `https://auth.example.com` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID registered with your IdP.                                                                             |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret. Omit for public clients (PKCE-only).                                                             |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`  | Must match what's registered with the IdP. e.g. `https://einvault.yourdomain.com/auth/oidc/callback`            |

### Optional variables

| Variable                        | Default                | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OIDC_SCOPES`                   | `openid profile email` | Space-separated scopes requested from the IdP.                                                             |
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME`            | `SSO`                  | Display label on the login button.                                                                         |
| `OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP`             | `false`                | If `true`, auto-creates accounts for users who authenticate but have no matching record. See below.        |
| `OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE`             | `member`               | Role assigned to auto-created users. Allowed: `member`, `caretaker`. Admin can only be granted via groups. |
| `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS`             | _(unset)_              | Comma-separated. Users whose `groups` claim contains any value here are promoted to admin on every login.  |
| `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` | _(unset)_              | If set and the IdP advertises `end_session_endpoint`, logout triggers RP-initiated logout at the IdP.      |
| `OIDC_STATE_SECRET`             | _(random)_             | Pin a long random string. Without it, in-flight logins break across server restarts.                       |

### Account linking

The callback decides which account to use in this order:

1. **Match by OIDC subject.** If the user has logged in via OIDC before, link by stored `(issuer, subject)`.
2. **Match by verified email.** If `email_verified` is `true` and the email matches an existing user, link the OIDC subject to that account.
3. **Auto-create.** Only if `OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP=true`. Username taken from `preferred_username` claim (sanitised, with numeric suffix on collision), or email local-part as fallback.
4. **Reject.** Otherwise, the user is returned to the login page with an "account not provisioned" message. An admin must create the account first.

By default (`OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP=false`), users must already exist in EinVault, or share an email with an existing account, to log in.

### Admin role mapping

If `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` is set, the user's `groups` claim is checked on **every** login. Membership in any listed group sets the user's role to `admin`; absence demotes them to the default role. Revoking admin at the IdP takes effect on next login.

If `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` is unset, OIDC does not touch user roles. Roles set in EinVault's admin UI are preserved across SSO logins.

`OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE` cannot grant admin; allowed values are `member` and `caretaker`.

Group membership is read from the top-level `groups` claim in the ID token, as an array of strings (a single string also works). Other claim names (`roles`, Keycloak's `realm_access.roles`) and nested claims aren't read. Configure your IdP to emit `groups` directly. See provider notes below.

### Logout

By default, logout destroys the local EinVault session and returns the user to `/auth/login`. Set `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` (and register it with your IdP) to also end the IdP session via [RP-initiated logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html).

### Provider notes

| Provider      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authelia**  | Register the redirect URI under the OIDC client config. Set `client_secret_basic` (default) or `none` for public clients.                                                                           |
| **Authentik** | Create an OAuth2/OIDC provider; scope mapping for `groups` is built-in. `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` matches the `groups` claim directly.                                                                    |
| **Keycloak**  | Add a "Group Membership" mapper to the client with token claim name `groups` and "Full group path" off. EinVault does not read `realm_access.roles`. Add the redirect URI to "Valid Redirect URIs". |
| **PocketID**  | Public-client first; omit `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Register the redirect URI in the client settings.                                                                                                   |

## Adding a new locale

1. Copy `src/lib/i18n/en.ts` to `src/lib/i18n/{code}.ts` (e.g. `ja.ts`) and translate every value. The file must `export default { ... } satisfies Record<keyof Messages, string>` — the compiler will catch any missing keys.
2. In `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`: import the new file, add the code to the `Locale` type, `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, `LOCALE_LABELS`, and `catalogs`.
3. In `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`: add the code to the `locale` enum on the `users` table.

No migration is needed — SQLite text columns don't enforce enums at the database level.
