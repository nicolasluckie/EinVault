## Production (Docker)

Requires Docker Engine 24+, Docker Compose v2, and a reverse proxy for TLS (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik, or similar).

Download [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](docker-compose.prod.yml) and set your domain before starting:

**`ORIGIN`** — your public domain:

```yaml
ORIGIN: https://einvault.yourdomain.com
```

Then:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Open your domain and follow the `/setup` prompt to create your admin account.

### Other options

Everything else in the compose file can be edited directly:

|                         | Default             | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TZ`                    | `UTC`               | Container timezone. Set to your local timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`) so dates and times display correctly.   |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB`         | `10`                | Maximum upload size in MB. SvelteKit's internal `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` is derived from this automatically at container start.          |
| `MAX_DAILY_PHOTOS`      | `5`                 | Maximum number of journal photos per companion per day.                                                                           |
| `REMINDER_UNDO_SECONDS` | `7`                 | Default undo window (seconds) when dismissing a Reminder. `0` disables the undo window. Each user can override in their settings. |
| `user`                  | `1000:1000`         | UID:GID the container runs as. Change if your `./data` directory has different ownership.                                         |
| `./data` volume         | `./data`            | Where the database and uploads are stored on the host.                                                                            |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | `/data/einvault.db` | Database path inside the container. Unlikely to need changing.                                                                    |

### Data and backup

Data lives in `./data` next to the compose file. Stop the container first so SQLite isn't mid-write, then copy the directory:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop einvault
cp -r ./data ./data.bak
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start einvault
```

### Container hardening

|                     |                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Runs as root        | No (runs as `node`, UID 1000) |
| `no-new-privileges` | Enabled                       |
| Linux capabilities  | All dropped                   |
| Root filesystem     | Read-only                     |
| Writable `/tmp`     | tmpfs, 64 MB                  |
| CPU limit           | 0.5 cores                     |
| Memory limit        | 256 MB                        |

### Image tags

| Tag            | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest`       | Latest stable release (published on version tags)   |
| `x.y.z`        | Pinned release                                      |
| `x.y`          | Latest patch of a minor release                     |
| `main`         | Latest commit on `main`, unstable, for testing only |
| `sha-<commit>` | Specific commit build, useful for rollback          |

### Verifying releases

Each release image carries a Sigstore-signed SLSA provenance attestation and a SPDX SBOM, and only ships after Trivy clears the OS and library packages on both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#verifying-releases) for the verification commands.

For tag selection:

- **`:latest`** is the lowest-friction default and what `docker-compose.prod.yml` uses. A `docker compose pull` will follow new releases automatically, so a hypothetical poisoned release would auto-deploy. Acceptable for casual homelab use, especially when paired with manual `gh attestation verify` before the pull.
- **`:vX.Y.Z`** pins to a specific release. Auto-updaters like Watchtower will not move past it. Recommended for production deployments.
- **`@sha256:<digest>`** pins to the exact bytes you verified. Immune to registry retags or future republishing. Recommended for hardened deployments.

---

## Docker (local build)

Builds the image locally instead of pulling from GHCR. Useful for testing Dockerfile changes or working on EinVault itself:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

All the same env vars work here. `ORIGIN` defaults to `http://localhost:3000` so no `.env` is needed for a basic smoke test.

---

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20+, npm 10+, and the native build tools for `better-sqlite3` and `sharp`:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3 g++ make`
- macOS: `brew install python3` (Xcode Command Line Tools provides g++ and make)

```bash
npm install
npm run db:generate   # generate migration files from the schema
npm run db:migrate    # apply migrations
npm run dev           # http://localhost:5173
```

No `.env` needed. The database defaults to `./data/einvault.db` and migrations run on startup. Open `http://localhost:5173` and you'll land on `/setup` to create your admin account.

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # production build
npm run check          # SvelteKit type checking
npm run lint           # ESLint + Prettier check
npm run format         # auto-format with Prettier
npm run db:generate    # generate a migration file after schema changes
npm run db:migrate     # apply pending migrations
npm run db:studio      # Drizzle Studio (visual database browser)
```

When you change `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`, run `db:generate` then `db:migrate` and commit both files together.

---

## User management

- First run redirects to `/setup` to create the initial admin account (one-time only)
- Manage users at `/admin/users`: create accounts, reset passwords, deactivate users
- No open registration

---

## OIDC / SSO (optional)

EinVault supports OpenID Connect for SSO with providers like Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak, and PocketID. OIDC runs alongside password login; existing users keep their passwords. A "Sign in with {provider}" button appears on the login page when OIDC is configured.

OIDC is **disabled** unless all required variables are set. Add them to your `.env` (local) or compose file (production), then restart.

Register `https://<your-domain>/auth/oidc/callback` as an allowed redirect URI with your IdP first.

### Required variables

| Variable             | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`    | IdP base URL. Discovery happens at `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. e.g. `https://auth.example.com` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID registered with your IdP.                                                                             |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret. Omit for public clients (PKCE-only).                                                             |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`  | Must match what's registered with the IdP. e.g. `https://einvault.yourdomain.com/auth/oidc/callback`            |

### Optional variables

| Variable                        | Default                | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OIDC_SCOPES`                   | `openid profile email` | Space-separated scopes requested from the IdP.                                                             |
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME`            | `SSO`                  | Display label on the login button.                                                                         |
| `OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP`             | `false`                | If `true`, auto-creates accounts for users who authenticate but have no matching record. See below.        |
| `OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE`             | `member`               | Role assigned to auto-created users. Allowed: `member`, `caretaker`. Admin can only be granted via groups. |
| `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS`             | _(unset)_              | Comma-separated. Users whose `groups` claim contains any value here are promoted to admin on every login.  |
| `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` | _(unset)_              | If set and the IdP advertises `end_session_endpoint`, logout triggers RP-initiated logout at the IdP.      |
| `OIDC_STATE_SECRET`             | _(random)_             | Pin a long random string. Without it, in-flight logins break across server restarts.                       |

### Account linking

The callback decides which account to use in this order:

1. **Match by OIDC subject.** If the user has logged in via OIDC before, link by stored `(issuer, subject)`.
2. **Match by verified email.** If `email_verified` is `true` and the email matches an existing user, link the OIDC subject to that account.
3. **Auto-create.** Only if `OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP=true`. Username taken from `preferred_username` claim (sanitised, with numeric suffix on collision), or email local-part as fallback.
4. **Reject.** Otherwise, the user is returned to the login page with an "account not provisioned" message. An admin must create the account first.

By default (`OIDC_ALLOW_SIGNUP=false`), users must already exist in EinVault, or share an email with an existing account, to log in.

### Admin role mapping

If `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` is set, the user's `groups` claim is checked on **every** login. Membership in any listed group sets the user's role to `admin`; absence demotes them to the default role. Revoking admin at the IdP takes effect on next login.

If `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` is unset, OIDC does not touch user roles. Roles set in EinVault's admin UI are preserved across SSO logins.

`OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE` cannot grant admin; allowed values are `member` and `caretaker`.

Group membership is read from the top-level `groups` claim in the ID token, as an array of strings (a single string also works). Other claim names (`roles`, Keycloak's `realm_access.roles`) and nested claims aren't read. Configure your IdP to emit `groups` directly. See provider notes below.

### Logout

By default, logout destroys the local EinVault session and returns the user to `/auth/login`. Set `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI` (and register it with your IdP) to also end the IdP session via [RP-initiated logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html).

### Provider notes

| Provider      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authelia**  | Register the redirect URI under the OIDC client config. Set `client_secret_basic` (default) or `none` for public clients.                                                                           |
| **Authentik** | Create an OAuth2/OIDC provider; scope mapping for `groups` is built-in. `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUPS` matches the `groups` claim directly.                                                                    |
| **Keycloak**  | Add a "Group Membership" mapper to the client with token claim name `groups` and "Full group path" off. EinVault does not read `realm_access.roles`. Add the redirect URI to "Valid Redirect URIs". |
| **PocketID**  | Public-client first; omit `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Register the redirect URI in the client settings.                                                                                                   |

## Adding a new locale

1. Copy `src/lib/i18n/en.ts` to `src/lib/i18n/{code}.ts` (e.g. `ja.ts`) and translate every value. The file must `export default { ... } satisfies Record<keyof Messages, string>` — the compiler will catch any missing keys.
2. In `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`: import the new file, add the code to the `Locale` type, `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, `LOCALE_LABELS`, and `catalogs`.
3. In `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`: add the code to the `locale` enum on the `users` table.

No migration is needed — SQLite text columns don't enforce enums at the database level.
